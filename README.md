This is a [Google Drive Ripoff](https://www.google.com/drive/) Made with [`Pocketbase`](https://pocketbase.io/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Second, download the pocketbase.exe file and run ./pocketbase serve (and if its hosted on a vps change the pocketbaseAdress in the constants.js file)

Third, open the pocketbase UI and make a user

Finally, Enjoy! You're now able to upload and download files and create folders
